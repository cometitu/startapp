                 <li>That the ballot has been cast correctly (using the “Verification” option available during vote casting)  </li>

                While election authorities can verify that all the recorded votes are correctly counted, only you know which candidate you want to vote for.
		Therefore, only you can verify that your cast ballot is stored   for your preferred candidate(s). In this way, you can have additional assurance
		that your vote is not modified even if your device or the voting system malfunctions or is manipulated.

   		 Secure E2E is designed to protect the integrity of the election process and prevent unauthorized
    		access or modification of the election results. Verification provides an extra level of assurance
    		for voters and the general population in the following ways:
  		</p>
  		<ul>
    		<li><b>Accuracy:</b> Verification helps detect and prevent errors, malfunctions,
      		or tampering that could compromise election results.</li>
    		<li><b>Voter confidence:</b> Each voter has the opportunity to
      		verify their own vote so that they know that their vote has been correctly included in the tally. </li>
    		<li><b>Timely error detection:</b> Verification processes help identify any discrepancies or errors early on. If a
       		voter notices a mistake or irregularity during the verification process, it can be addressed and corrected promptly.  </li>
    		<li><b>Accountability: </b>Verification holds the election authorities accountable for maintaining accurate records and conducting
     		a fair election. It establishes a system of checks and balances, ensuring that the voting process is conducted according to the corresponding regulations..</li>

		 The “Verification” option works as follows: Imagine that after you select your preferred candidate,
   		 your ballot is put into an envelope and sealed. This corresponds to your choice being encrypted.
    		Then, you can choose either to submit the envelope with your ballot to the digital ballot box
    		(cast the vote) or to open the envelope to check whether it contains the vote for the correct candidate (verify).
    		If your vote has been modified, you can detect it by verifying. If the verification did not detect any modification, 
                you can proceed with preparing a new ballot, which you can either choose to verify again for an extra assurance or cast.

                The Secure ballot tracker is like a typical tracking number, say for shipping a package, meaning that using this

                The Secure Voting system takes great care to protect the secrecy of your vote. Your ballot is encrypted on your computer
		before it is even sent to the voting system. It can only be decrypted by a set of trustees, who must combine their secret keys together.
		The Secure Voting system uses advanced cryptographic techniques that allow combining all the encrypted votes into an encrypted tally, and only the tally is decrypted by the trustees. That means that the contents of individual votes are not revealed to anyone.

   		 The Secure Voting system provides further security assurances to ensure vote integrity, vote secrecy, and system availability during the voting process. Here are some common security assurances provided by the system:
  		</p>
  		<ul>
    		<li><b>Authentication and Authorization:</b> A strong authentication mechanism is in place to ensure that only
      		eligible voters can participate. This typically involves verifying the identity of the voter
      		through unique login credentials, digital certificates, or multi-factor authentication.
      		The Secure E2E voting system utilizes unique login credentials as the authentication method.
       		Authorization mechanisms grant appropriate access rights to participants,
       		e.g. voters or election authorities, based on their roles and privileges.  </li>

    		<li><b>Independent Security Audits:</b> Regular independent security audits and penetration testing
      		are conducted to identify vulnerabilities and assess the overall security posture of the system.
      		These audits help uncover any weaknesses or flaws that could be exploited and allow for timely remediation.  </li>
  		</ul>
